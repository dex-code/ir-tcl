------------------------------------------------------

         interface becomes 'ready' immediately.

06/20/95 New setting: failInfo. It returns failback diagnostics.

06/21/95 Bitmaps (book[1-9]) moved to subdirectory bitmaps.

06/21/95 Install procedure change. GNU autoconf used to create the
         Makefile. The user may type 'make install' to copy system files
         to /usr/local/...

         as a Tcl string.

         when installed in the directory with executables.
