------------------------------------------------------

         interface becomes 'ready' immediately.

06/21/95 Bitmaps (book[1-9]) moved to subdirectory bitmaps.

06/21/95 Install procedure change. GNU autoconf used to create the
         Makefile. The user may type 'make install' to copy system files
         to /usr/local/...

         as a Tcl string.

         it works like wish. The demonstrating client is named 'irclient'
         when installed in the directory with executables.
