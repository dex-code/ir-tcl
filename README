This is a very early alpha-release of IrTcl.

In order to compile you need:
   
  o  An ANSI-C compiler such as GNU C
  o  Tcl version 7.3
  o  YAZ version 0.2 beta or higher

You may also need:

  o  Tk version 3.6 
  o  The XTI/mosi package

Compilation:
  1) Compile/install yaz/tcl, etc.

  2) Edit Makefile (in current directory)
     Set MOSI to 1/0
     Define include directory paths of yaz/tcl/tk
     Define libraries of yaz/tcl/tk

  3) Type 'make ir-tcl' to make the Tcl version or IrTcl.
     Type 'make ir-tk' to make the Tk version of IrTcl.

  4) The resulting files are:
     ir-tcl                     Tcl version of IrTcl
     ir-tk                      Tk version of IrTcl
     marc.tcl/iterate.tcl       small IrTcl scripts
